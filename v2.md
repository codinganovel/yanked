# Yanked v2.0.1 - Complete Feature Overview

## Major Changes from v1.0

### 1. **Dual Installation Methods**

**v1.0:** Only supported direct script installation
**v2.0:** Two distinct installation methods with different behaviors

#### Method: `scr` (Script Installation)
- **Purpose:** Install single executable files (Python scripts, shell scripts, etc.)
- **Behavior:** 
  - Downloads file directly to `~/.local/bin/app-name`
  - Makes file executable
  - Tracks exact file location for clean uninstalls
  - Hash-based update detection (only updates if file changed)
- **Use Cases:** Simple command-line tools, single-file applications

#### Method: `inst` (Custom Installer)
- **Purpose:** Run custom installation scripts for complex software
- **Behavior:**
  - Downloads install script to temporary file in `/tmp/yanked/`
  - **Replaces yanked process** with installer using `os.execv()` (NOT subprocess)
  - Only tracks basic install info (no file or version tracking)
  - Always runs installer on upgrade (no hash checking)
  - Installer gets full terminal control and complete process ownership
- **Use Cases:** Complex software with dependencies, multi-file applications, anything requiring custom setup

### 2. **Enhanced Interactive Installation Flow**

**v1.0 Flow:**
```
Enter URL: → Enter file path: → Enter app name: → Install
```

**v2.0 Flow:**
```
Enter URL: → [Enter file path:] → Method [scr/inst]: → Enter app name: → Install
```

#### New Method Selection Prompt
- Always asks user to choose installation method
- Clear `[scr/inst]` prompt with validation
- Method determines how yanked handles the downloaded file

#### Consistent for All URL Types
- **Raw GitHub URLs:** Asks for method + app name (skips file path)
- **Repository URLs:** Asks for file path + method + app name
- Same user experience regardless of URL format

### 3. **Intelligent Upgrade Behavior**

**v1.0:** Simple hash comparison for all upgrades
**v2.0:** Method-specific upgrade logic

#### Script Method Upgrades (`scr`)
- Downloads latest file
- Compares SHA256 hash with stored version
- **If unchanged:** "already up to date" - no reinstallation
- **If changed:** Updates file and shows hash comparison

#### Custom Installer Upgrades (`inst`)
- Downloads latest installer script
- **Always runs installer** - no hash comparison
- Assumes installer knows how to handle updates/upgrades
- Lets custom installer handle version detection and file management

### 4. **Enhanced Package Tracking**

**v1.0 Package Record:**
```json
{
  "app-name": {
    "source_url": "...",
    "file_url": "...",
    "install_date": "...",
    "file_path": "...",
    "file_hash": "..."
  }
}
```

**v2.0 Package Record:**
```json
{
  "app-name": {
    "method": "scr|inst",
    "source_url": "...",
    "file_url": "...", 
    "install_date": "...",
    "file_path": "..." (scr only),
    "file_hash": "..."
  }
}
```

#### New Fields
- **`method`**: Tracks installation method for proper upgrade/uninstall handling
- **Conditional tracking**: `file_path` only stored for `scr` method

### 5. **Method-Aware Uninstallation**

**v1.0:** Always tries to delete tracked file
**v2.0:** Different behavior based on installation method

#### Script Method Uninstall (`scr`)
- Shows exact file location to be removed
- Removes tracked file from `~/.local/bin/`
- Clean, predictable uninstallation

#### Custom Installer Uninstall (`inst`)
- Shows warning about non-tracked installation
- Only removes from yanked's database
- Informs user: *"Files installed by the custom installer may need manual cleanup"*
- Suggests checking original repository for uninstall scripts

### 6. **Improved User Experience**

#### Enhanced Installation Summary
**v1.0:**
```
Source URL: ...
Download URL: ...
App name: ...
Install location: ...
```

**v2.0:**
```
Source URL: ...
Download URL: ...
Method: scr/inst
App name: ...
Install location: ... (scr) / Custom installer - location determined by install script (inst)
```

#### Better Status Messages
- Method-specific progress indicators
- Clear distinction between script installation and custom installer execution
- Informative warnings for non-tracked installations

#### Backward Compatibility
- Existing v1.0 installations work seamlessly
- Missing `method` field defaults to `scr` for old packages
- No migration required

## Technical Implementation Details

### Process Replacement (Critical Architecture)
**Custom installers use `os.execv()` NOT `subprocess.run()`:**
- yanked process is completely replaced by installer script
- No parent-child relationship - installer becomes the main process
- Package records must be saved BEFORE exec (yanked won't return)
- Installer script gets full terminal ownership (colors, input, signals)
- No return code handling needed - installer controls its own exit

### Temporary File Management
- **Dedicated directory**: `/tmp/yanked/` for all yanked temp files
- **Automatic cleanup**: Every yanked startup clears `/tmp/yanked/` of old files
- **Organized naming**: `installer_{app_name}_{pid}` for uniqueness
- **Safe cleanup**: Ignores permission errors, won't crash on inaccessible files
- **No accumulation**: Leftover temp files from crashed/killed processes get cleaned up

### Error Handling & Recovery
- Installation method validation with clear error messages
- **show_info() crash fix**: Method-aware display prevents crashes on `inst` packages
- Graceful degradation for malformed package records
- **File extension flexibility**: Temp installers support any executable type (not just .sh)
- Backward compatibility via `info.get('method', 'scr')` defaults

## Version History & Bug Fixes

- Process replacement for custom installers
- Method-specific upgrade and uninstall logic
- Enhanced package tracking with method awareness

### Migration from v1.0

## Use Cases Enabled by v2.0

### Simple Scripts (Use `scr` method)
- Python CLI tools
- Shell script utilities  
- Single-file applications
- Anything that just needs to be executable in PATH

### Complex Software (Use `inst` method)
- Software requiring compilation
- Multi-file applications
- Tools with dependencies
- Applications needing system integration
- Software with complex setup requirements

### Real-World Examples

#### Script Installation
```bash
yanked install
# URL: https://github.com/user/simple-tool
# File: tool.py
# Method: scr
# App: simple-tool
# Result: ~/.local/bin/simple-tool (executable Python script)
```

#### Custom Installer
```bash
yanked install  
# URL: https://github.com/complex/software
# File: install.sh
# Method: inst  
# App: complex-software
# Result: Installer runs, handles its own file placement and setup
```

## Development Philosophy

### Method Separation (Core Design Principle)
- **yanked-controlled (`scr`)**: Yanked knows exactly what it installed and can clean up completely
- **developer-controlled (`inst`)**: **Yanked stays completely out of the way** - no file tracking, no version management, no cleanup attempts

### User Choice & Transparency
- Always ask user to specify method - no assumptions or auto-detection
- Clear documentation of what each method does and doesn't do
- **Transparent about limitations**: Custom installers are explicitly untracked
- Method-specific warnings during uninstall

### Process Control Architecture
- **Script method**: yanked controls the entire lifecycle
- **Installer method**: yanked transfers complete control via exec, never returns
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- No hybrid approaches or middle ground

### Backward Compatibility
- Never break existing installations
- Graceful handling of missing fields
- Sensible defaults for old package records (`method` defaults to `scr`)

### Cleanup & Resource Management
- Proactive temp file cleanup on every startup
- Dedicated temp directory for easy maintenance
- No resource leaks from process replacement

---

**yanked v2.0.1** transforms a simple script installer into a universal GitHub package manager that can handle both simple scripts and complex software installations while maintaining the simplicity and interactive nature that made v1.0 successful. The dual-method architecture provides complete control separation: yanked manages what it can track (`scr`) and stays completely out of the way for what it can't (`inst`).
